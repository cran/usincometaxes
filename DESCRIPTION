Description: Calculates federal and state income taxes in the United States. It acts as a wrapper 
    to the NBER's TAXSIM 35 (<http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35/>) tax simulator. TAXSIM 35 conducts 
    the calculations, while 'usincometaxes' prepares the data for TAXSIM 35, sends the data to 
    TAXSIM 35's server, retrieves the data, and places it into a data frame. All without the user
    worrying about this process.
